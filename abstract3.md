# Should you Follow the Food Groups for Dietary Advice?

###### by Kaitlyn Keil and Kevin Zhang

###### Data Science Spring 2017

In the 1990s, the USDA put out the image of a Food Guide Pyramid to help direct dietary choices. It grouped foods into six categories: grains, proteins (meats, fish, eggs, etc), vegetables, fruits, dairy, and fats and oils. Since then, the pyramid has been revamped in 2005, and pushed towards a plate with five categories (oils were dropped) in the 2010s. The general population generally learns of these basic food groups since grade school, and over time either fully adopts them into their lifestyles, or abandons them to pursue their own balanced diet. In light of the controversy surrounding the Food Pyramid, we decided to ask whether the food categories found in the Food Pyramid truly represent the correct groupings for food, and if not, just how far off are they? Using K-Means clustering on an extensive food databank, we created 6 groupings of food based on their macronutrient composition. We found that the K-Means groups only overlapped with existing food groups from the Food Pyramid 50% of the time, potentially suggesting that the idea of basic food groups could be outdated.
