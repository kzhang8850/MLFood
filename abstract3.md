# Clustering Around the Food Pyramid

###### by Kaitlyn Keil and Kevin Zhang

###### April 2017

In the 1990s, the USDA put out the image of a food guide pyramid to help direct dietary choices. It grouped foods into six categories: grains, proteins (meats, fish, eggs, etc), vegetables, fruits, dairy, and fats and oils. Since then, the pyramid has been revamped in 2005, and pushed towards a plate with five categories (oils were dropped) in the 2010s. Using K-Means clustering, we created 6 groupings of food based on the macronutrient composition. We found that these new groups only overlapped with existing groups 50% of the time. <a href= >Read more here</a>.
